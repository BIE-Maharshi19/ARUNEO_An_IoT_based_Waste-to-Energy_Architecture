# An IoT based waste-to-energy architecture for urban landscape
To develop an IoT-based ecosystem that connects and integrate housing society, municipal bodies, by providing them the relevant waste data. In the year 2021-2022, India produces about 0.15 million tons of waste. Of the total waste collected only 20% is processed, the rest is dumped at landfill sites. The underlying problem municipal bodies is due to inadequate, inaccurate and desegrated waste data. Proposed model caters a
solution for the same by integrating an IoT based ecosystem in housing society. The system is divided in three main parts : 
1) Collector System: An automated collection trolley, for dumping waste and storage of resident waste data. After the daily collection the waste picker has to just connect the Arduino (Trolley) to a Node-Mcu pad in the secretary office to transmit it to server in JSON.
2) Data computing and Django Server: Cloud simulation on Raspberry Pie board for various functions.
3) Resident and Secretary Dashboard: An interactive web-page based residents and secretary dashboard.
